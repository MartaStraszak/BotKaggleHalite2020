This is my bot for Halite by Two Sigma that I started writing for the [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite) hosted by Kaggle. Unfortunately due to lack of time I didn't have the chance to finish it and make it get reasonable scores. The last version uses a **genetic algorithm** to find a sequence of actions independently for each ship.

# Trick to Invoke C++ code

One interesting trick that is hidden in the solution is that even though the challenge allowed only Python bot submissions, the code of my bot was still written in C++. Even more interestingly: this was **not against the rules** :) How can this be achieved?

 1. You can see that my solution file is a Python program, but a very strange one.
 2. Within the Python code, a C++ source is embedded as a string.
 3. The Python code, when run, does the following:
	 - Writes the C++ code to a `.cpp` file,
	 - Invokes `g++` to compile the `.cpp` source,
	 - Executes the compiled binary and passes it the input data,
	 - Reads the output of the execution and returns the answer.

One can wonder, why go through all this mess? Just to use C++ instead of Python? Then answer is: Yes, because even with all the overhead generated by the above procedure, the speedup when going from Python to C++ is definitely worth it. Python is just incredibly slow, and writing AI bots in Python (where speed is of utter importance) is not a good idea.
